# Image Rotation Using Matrix Operations

### Overview
This project demonstrates how to rotate an image using matrix operations. Each pixel of an image, represented by its RGB values, is mapped into a matrix. The project involves extracting pixel values,
displaying them as square blocks, and performing rotations through matrix transformations. The goal is to visualize the application of matrix operations in image manipulation.
